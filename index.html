                  You could hire the best wedding photographer in delhi, NCR,
                  india, but if you donâ€™t communicate your desires and
                  expectations or plan out the shots that you want for the
                  event, the photographs arenâ€™t going to come out the way that
                  you wanted them to. Openly discuss the details with your
                  wedding photographer so that youâ€™re both on the same page.
                  This will also help your photographer prepare for the big day
                  and ensure that there will be no out-of-the-blue surprises.

                <p class="multi-line">
                  In light of planning, notify your wedding photographer about
                  specific shots that you want during the event. Whether itâ€™s
                  the kiss, the cutting of the cake, the walk down the aisle, or
                  even pre wedding preparations in the backroom, letting the
                  photographer know that you want some pictures taken of these
                  moments will increase the chances of a successful outcome for
                  your wedding album. The Indian wedding photographer is likely
                  aware of the best times to take photos due to his/her
                  professional experience, but there are some instances where
                  you might want to have shots taken in unorthodox situations.
                  Discussing these in advance will make certain that every photo
                  worth taking is accounted for.

                  Photography is all about angles. If youâ€™re wedding
                  photographer finds himself surrounded by a sea of wedding
                  guests because you did not plan a proper location for him/her,
                  taking excellent pictures is next to impossible. Setting up
                  separate areas ahead of time that the photographer can use to
                  capture different scenes of your wedding will minimize
                  distractions and interruptions. It will also guarantee that
                  your uncleâ€™s bald head wonâ€™t suddenly pop out of nowhere and
                  block the shot.

                  Having a family member work with the photographer and
                  coordinate with the guests to ensure that everyone is included
                  in important photos is essential. More often than not, the
                  photographer does not know any of the guests intimately and
                  may have trouble organizing everyone, especially in group
                  photos. Working with a family member makes sure that no one is
                  left out.

                  The photographs from your wedding will provide memories that
                  last a lifetime. Theyâ€™re the only mementos that can invoke the
                  myriad of emotions felt on your wedding day years after the
                  event. Taking extra care in selecting the right wedding
                  photographer and planning ahead for the shots that you want
                  will go a long way in securing your photo albumâ€™s status as an
                  attraction centerpiece rather than a cobweb collector in some
                  dusty attic.

                  There are typically two types of videography styles: cinematic
                  style wedding videography and documentary style wedding
                  videography in india. Cinematic videos are like movies and
                  include music, special effects and montages. They involve the
                  videographer shooting sections of the wedding and editing them
                  together later. Documentary videos are generally shot
                  consistently throughout the day and show the progression of
                  the wedding day from start to finish. Make sure that you and
                  your videographer are on the same page about what is expected
                  from the final product and what kind of story you want your
                  video to tell.

                  Although you may not be familiar with the technical terms,
                  asking your potential videographer what kind of equipment he
                  uses is an indicator of his level of expertise and also what
                  the setup will look like at the wedding? Sometimes video gear
                  can be very bulky and would interfere with the ceremony so
                  youâ€™ll want to double check that your videographerâ€™s equipment
                  wonâ€™t get in the way. Having good sound and lighting is
                  crucial for a great video and all good videographers will have
                  a way to capture the best sound and provide the best lighting
                  for your wedding video.

                  Watching a sample movie is the best way to determine whether
                  or not someone is a potential videographer for your wedding.
                  If you watch a couple of sample videos and donâ€™t feel that
                  they are the type of video you want, youâ€™ll know that
                  videographer is not for you. If you watch a couple of videos
                  and instantly fall in love, youâ€™ll know that this videographer
                  is someone you would want to work with. Asking for references
                  is something that any professional videographer should be used
                  to and be happy to provide. Speaking with past clients will
                  help you gauge what to expect from this particular
                  videographer for your special day.

                  Of course one of the most important things to ask your
                  videographer is how much his services will cost. Many times
                  videographers offer package deals that include their time, the
                  video, editing and extra copies. Review all of the package
                  options carefully to make sure everything you want and need is
                  included at a price that you are comfortable with. Also ask
                  about overtime charges in case the ceremony or reception runs
                  long so that you arenâ€™t surprised with extra costs when the
                  bill comes.

                  Your wedding video will be a lovely keepsake for you and your
                  loved ones to enjoy for years to come. Each videographer will
                  spend a different amount of time on your video depending on
                  his editing process and schedule; some may deliver your
                  finished movie in as little as 8 weeks, while others may take
                  up to an entire year. Ask your videographer what a typical
                  turnaround time is for him so that you have an idea of when
                  youâ€™ll be able to see your beautiful movie.
